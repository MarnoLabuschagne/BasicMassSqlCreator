The
wolves
stopped
in
their
tracks
sizing
up
the
mother
and
her
cubs
It
had
been
over
a
week
since
their
last
meal
and
they
were
getting
desperate
The
cubs
would
make
a
good
meal
but
there
were
high
risks
taking
on
the
mother
Grizzly
decision
had
to
be
made
and
the
wrong
choice
could
signal
the
end
of
the
pack
She
tried
to
explain
that
love
wasn`t
like
pie
There
wasn`t
a
set
number
of
slices
to
be
given
out
There
wasn`t
less
to
be
given
to
one
person
if
you
wanted
to
give
more
to
another
That
after
a
set
amount
was
given
out
it
would
all
disappear
She
tried
to
explain
this
but
it
fell
on
deaf
ears
It
was
a
simple
tip
of
the
hat
Grace
didn`t
think
that
anyone
else
besides
her
had
even
noticed
it
It
wasn`t
anything
that
the
average
person
would
notice
let
alone
remember
at
the
end
of
the
day
That`s
why
it
seemed
so
unbelievable
that
this
little
gesture
would
ultimately
change
the
course
of
the
world
There
was
only
one
way
to
do
things
in
the
Statton
house
That
one
way
was
to
do
exactly
what
the
father
Charlie
demanded
He
made
the
decisions
and
everyone
else
followed
without
question
That
was
until
today
Do
you
really
listen
when
you
are
talking
with
someone
I
have
a
friend
who
listens
in
an
unforgiving
way
She
actually
takes
every
word
you
say
as
being
something
important
and
when
you
have
a
friend
that
listens
like
that
words
take
on
a
whole
new
meaning
All
he
could
think
about
was
how
it
would
all
end
There
was
still
a
bit
of
uncertainty
in
the
equation
but
the
basics
were
there
for
anyone
to
see
No
matter
how
much
he
tried
to
see
the
positive
it
wasn`t
anywhere
to
be
seen
The
end
was
coming
and
it
wasn`t
going
to
be
pretty
She
was
aware
that
things
could
go
wrong
In
fact
she
had
trained
her
entire
life
in
anticipation
that
things
would
go
wrong
one
day
She
had
quiet
confidence
as
she
started
to
see
that
this
was
the
day
that
all
her
training
would
be
worthwhile
and
useful
At
this
point
she
had
no
idea
just
how
wrong
everything
would
go
that
day
It
had
been
her
dream
for
years
but
Dana
had
failed
to
take
any
action
toward
making
it
come
true
There
had
always
been
a
good
excuse
to
delay
or
prioritize
another
project
As
she
woke
she
realized
she
was
once
again
at
a
crossroads
Would
it
be
another
excuse
or
would
she
finally
find
the
courage
to
pursue
her
dream
Dana
rose
and
took
her
first
step
He
lifted
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
took
a
sip
of
the
drink
He
had
tasted
this
before
but
he
couldn`t
quite
remember
the
time
and
place
it
had
happened
He
desperately
searched
his
mind
trying
to
locate
and
remember
where
he
had
tasted
this
when
the
bicycle
ran
over
his
foot
There
was
nothing
else
to
do
The
deed
had
already
been
done
and
there
was
no
going
back
It
now
had
been
become
a
question
of
how
they
were
going
to
be
able
to
get
out
of
this
situation
and
escape
Benny
was
tired
Not
the
normal
every
day
tired
from
a
hard
day
work
The
exhausted
type
of
tired
where
you`re
surprised
your
body
can
even
move
All
he
wanted
to
do
was
sit
in
front
of
the
TV
put
his
feet
up
on
the
coffee
table
and
drink
a
beer
The
only
issue
was
that
he
had
forgotten
where
he
lived
It
was
easy
to
spot
her
All
you
needed
to
do
was
look
at
her
socks
They
were
never
a
matching
pair
One
would
be
green
while
the
other
would
be
blue
One
would
reach
her
knee
while
the
other
barely
touched
her
ankle
Every
other
part
of
her
was
perfect
but
never
the
socks
They
were
her
micro
act
of
rebellion
The
river
slowly
meandered
through
the
open
space
It
had
hidden
secrets
that
it
didn`t
want
to
reveal
It
had
a
well-planned
strategy
to
appear
calm
inviting
and
appealing
That`s
how
the
river
lured
her
unknowing
victims
to
her
water`s
edge
Twenty-five
hours
had
passed
since
the
incident
It
seemed
to
be
a
lot
longer
than
that
That
twenty-five
hours
seemed
more
like
a
week
in
her
mind
The
fact
that
she
still
was
having
trouble
comprehending
exactly
what
took
place
wasn`t
helping
the
matter
She
thought
if
she
could
just
get
a
little
rest
the
entire
incident
might
make
a
little
more
sense
Housework
could
be
everyone’s
work
not
just
women’s
work”
Why
do
women
enable
men
to
act
oblivious
to
cleaning
grocery
shopping
pet
feeding
etc
Somehow
when
men
live
alone
they
figure
out
how
to
do
all
of
those
things
all
on
their
own
My
friend’s
husband
claimed
he
didn’t
know
that
sheets
should
be
washed
more
than
once
a
season
He
said
he
didn’t
know
one
had
to
clean
toilets
He
assumed
that
since
you
flush
toilets
they
clean
themselves
She
tried
to
get
him
to
help
but
he
did
an
awful
job
so
she
let
him
off
the
hook
Wouldn’t
it
be
better
if
she
spent
the
time
and
energy
to
get
him
to
do
it
right
instead
of
letting
him
claim
he
is
just
bad
at
it”
My
sons
were
raised
to
clean
toilets
and
change
their
own
sheets
Hopefully
in
their
future
homes
the
housework
will
be
equally
divided
Sometimes
it`s
simply
better
to
ignore
the
haters
That`s
the
lesson
that
Tom`s
dad
had
been
trying
to
teach
him
but
Tom
still
couldn`t
let
it
go
He
latched
onto
them
and
their
hate
and
couldn`t
let
it
go
but
he
also
realized
that
this
wasn`t
healthy
That`s
when
he
came
up
with
his
devious
plan
Finding
the
truth
wouldn`t
be
easy
that`s
for
sure
Then
there
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
Jane
really
wanted
to
know
the
truth
That`s
the
thing
that
bothered
her
most
It
wasn`t
the
difficulty
of
actually
finding
out
what
happened
that
was
the
obstacle
but
having
to
live
with
that
information
once
it
was
found
Devon
couldn`t
figure
out
the
color
of
her
eyes
He
initially
would
have
guessed
that
they
were
green
but
the
more
he
looked
at
them
he
almost
wanted
to
say
they
were
a
golden
yellow
Then
there
were
the
flashes
of
red
and
orange
that
seemed
to
be
streaked
throughout
them
It
was
almost
as
if
her
eyes
were
made
of
opal
with
the
sun
constantly
glinting
off
of
them
and
bringing
out
more
color
They
were
definitely
the
most
unusual
pair
of
eyes
he`d
ever
seen
I`m
going
to
hire
professional
help
tomorrow
I
can`t
handle
this
anymore
She
fell
over
the
coffee
table
and
now
there
is
blood
in
her
catheter
This
is
much
more
than
I
ever
signed
up
to
do
I`m
so
confused
by
your
ridiculous
meltdown
that
I
must
insist
on
some
sort
of
explanation
for
your
behavior
towards
me
It
just
doesn`t
make
any
sense
There`s
no
way
that
I
deserved
the
treatment
you
gave
me
without
an
explanation
or
an
apology
for
how
out
of
line
you
have
been
The
water
rush
down
the
wash
and
into
the
slot
canyon
below
Two
hikers
had
started
the
day
to
sunny
weather
without
a
cloud
in
the
sky
but
they
hadn`t
thought
to
check
the
weather
north
of
the
canyon
Huge
thunderstorms
had
brought
a
deluge
rain
and
produced
flash
floods
heading
their
way
The
two
hikers
had
no
idea
what
was
coming
He
had
three
simple
rules
by
which
he
lived
The
first
was
to
never
eat
blue
food
There
was
nothing
in
nature
that
was
edible
that
was
blue
People
often
asked
about
blueberries
but
everyone
knows
those
are
actually
purple
He
understood
it
was
one
of
the
stranger
rules
to
live
by
but
it
had
served
him
well
thus
far
in
the
50+
years
of
his
life
His
parents
continued
to
question
him
He
didn`t
know
what
to
say
to
them
since
they
refused
to
believe
the
truth
He
explained
again
and
again
and
they
dismissed
his
explanation
as
a
figment
of
his
imagination
There
was
no
way
that
grandpa
who
had
been
dead
for
five
years
could
have
told
him
where
the
treasure
had
been
hidden
Of
course
it
didn`t
help
that
grandpa
was
roaring
with
laughter
in
the
chair
next
to
him
as
he
tried
to
explain
once
again
how
he`d
found
it
There
are
only
three
ways
to
make
this
work
The
first
is
to
let
me
take
care
of
everything
The
second
is
for
you
to
take
care
of
everything
The
third
is
to
split
everything
50
50
I
think
the
last
option
is
the
most
preferable
but
I`m
certain
it`ll
also
mean
the
end
of
our
marriage
Sometimes
it`s
the
first
moment
of
the
day
that
catches
you
off
guard
That`s
what
Wendy
was
thinking
She
opened
her
window
to
see
fire
engines
screeching
down
the
street
While
this
wasn`t
something
completely
unheard
of
it
also
wasn`t
normal
It
was
a
sure
sign
of
what
was
going
to
happen
that
day
She
could
feel
it
in
her
bones
and
it
wasn`t
the
way
she
wanted
the
day
to
begin
It
had
been
a
rough
day
Things
hadn`t
gone
as
planned
and
that
meant
Hannah
got
yelled
at
by
her
boss
It
didn`t
even
matter
that
it
wasn`t
her
fault
When
things
went
wrong
at
work
Hannah
got
the
blame
no
matter
the
actual
circumstances
It
wasn`t
fair
but
there
was
little
she
could
do
without
risking
her
job
and
she
wasn`t
in
a
position
to
do
that
with
the
plans
she
had
MaryLou
wore
the
tiara
with
pride
There
was
something
that
made
doing
anything
she
didn`t
really
want
to
do
a
bit
easier
when
she
wore
it
She
really
didn`t
care
what
those
staring
through
the
window
were
thinking
as
she
vacuumed
her
apartment
It
was
that
terrifying
feeling
you
have
as
you
tightly
hold
the
covers
over
you
with
the
knowledge
that
there
is
something
hiding
under
your
bed
You
want
to
look
but
you
don`t
at
the
same
time
You`re
frozen
with
fear
and
unable
to
act
That`s
where
she
found
herself
and
she
didn`t
know
what
to
do
next
Since
they
are
still
preserved
in
the
rocks
for
us
to
see
they
must
have
been
formed
quite
recently
that
is
geologically
speaking
What
can
explain
these
striations
and
their
common
orientation
Did
you
ever
hear
about
the
Great
Ice
Age
or
the
Pleistocene
Epoch
Less
than
one
million
years
ago
in
fact
some
12
000
years
ago
an
ice
sheet
many
thousands
of
feet
thick
rode
over
Burke
Mountain
in
a
southeastward
direction
The
many
boulders
frozen
to
the
underside
of
the
ice
sheet
tended
to
scratch
the
rocks
over
which
they
rode
The
scratches
or
striations
seen
in
the
park
rocks
were
caused
by
these
attached
boulders
The
ice
sheet
also
plucked
and
rounded
Burke
Mountain
into
the
shape
it
possesses
today
There
wasn`t
a
whole
lot
he
could
do
at
that
moment
He
played
the
situation
again
and
again
in
his
head
looking
at
what
he
might
have
done
differently
to
make
the
situation
better
No
matter
how
many
times
he
relived
the
situation
in
his
head
there
was
never
really
a
good
alternative
course
of
action
There
simply
wasn`t
a
whole
lot
he
could
have
done
in
that
particular
moment
He
was
after
the
truth
At
least
that`s
what
he
told
himself
He
believed
it
but
any
rational
person
on
the
outside
could
see
he
was
lying
to
himself
It
was
apparent
he
was
really
only
after
his
own
truth
that
he`d
already
decided
and
was
after
this
truth
because
the
facts
didn`t
line
up
with
the
truth
he
wanted
So
he
continued
to
tell
everyone
he
was
after
the
truth
oblivious
to
the
real
truth
sitting
right
in
front
of
him
Love
isn`t
always
a
ray
of
sunshine
That`s
what
the
older
girls
kept
telling
her
when
she
said
she
had
found
the
perfect
man
She
had
thought
this
was
simply
bitter
talk
on
their
part
since
they
had
been
unable
to
find
true
love
like
hers
But
now
she
had
to
face
the
fact
that
they
may
have
been
right
Love
may
not
always
be
a
ray
of
sunshine
That
is
unless
they
were
referring
to
how
the
sun
can
burn
There
was
something
special
about
this
little
creature
Donna
couldn`t
quite
pinpoint
what
it
was
but
she
knew
with
all
her
heart
that
it
was
true
It
wasn`t
a
matter
of
if
she
was
going
to
try
and
save
it
but
a
matter
of
how
she
was
going
to
save
it
She
went
back
to
the
car
to
get
a
blanket
and
when
she
returned
the
creature
was
gone
She
put
the
pen
to
paper
but
she
couldn`t
bring
herself
to
actually
write
anything
She
just
stared
at
the
blank
card
and
wondered
what
words
she
could
write
that
would
help
in
even
a
small
way
She
thought
of
a
dozen
ways
to
begin
but
none
seemed
to
do
justice
to
the
situation
There
were
no
words
that
could
help
and
she
knew
it
The
headphones
were
on
They
had
been
utilized
on
purpose
She
could
hear
her
mom
yelling
in
the
background
but
couldn`t
make
out
exactly
what
the
yelling
was
about
That
was
exactly
why
she
had
put
them
on
She
knew
her
mom
would
enter
her
room
at
any
minute
and
she
could
pretend
that
she
hadn`t
heard
any
of
the
previous
yelling
Wandering
down
the
path
to
the
pond
had
become
a
daily
routine
Even
when
the
weather
wasn`t
cooperating
like
today
with
the
wind
and
rain
Jerry
still
took
the
morning
stroll
down
the
path
until
he
reached
the
pond
Although
there
didn`t
seem
to
be
a
particular
reason
Jerry
did
this
to
anyone
looking
in
from
the
outside
those
who
knew
him
well
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on
It
could
all
be
traced
back
to
a
specific
incident
that
happened
exactly
years
previously
Do
you
think
you`re
living
an
ordinary
life
You
are
so
mistaken
it`s
difficult
to
even
explain
The
mere
fact
that
you
exist
makes
you
extraordinary
The
odds
of
you
existing
are
less
than
winning
the
lottery
but
here
you
are
Are
you
going
to
let
this
extraordinary
opportunity
pass
I
don’t
like
cats
and
they
don’t
like
me
I
used
to
be
allergic
to
them
and
I
would
get
stuffed
up
and
have
hives
That
doesn’t
seem
to
happen
anymore
But
I
still
don’t
like
them
I
lived
with
cats
that
were
not
good
at
peeing
in
the
litter
box
They
seemed
to
find
something
important
to
me
and
pee
on
it
Most
of
the
time
they
peed
on
photographs
or
papers
that
would
be
ruined
Cats
also
bring
fleas
into
the
house
There
is
nothing
worse
than
having
to
flea
dip
cats
and
also
flea
bomb
a
home
That
is
why
I
don’t
like
cats
She
patiently
waited
for
his
number
to
be
called
She
had
no
desire
to
be
there
but
her
mom
had
insisted
that
she
go
She`s
resisted
at
first
but
over
time
she
realized
it
was
simply
easier
to
appease
her
and
go
Mom
tended
to
be
that
way
She
would
keep
insisting
until
you
wore
down
and
did
what
she
wanted
So
here
she
sat
patiently
waiting
for
her
number
to
be
called
Sleep
deprivation
causes
all
sorts
of
challenges
and
problems
When
one
doesn’t
get
enough
sleep
one’s
mind
doesn’t
work
clearly
Studies
have
shown
that
after
staying
awake
for
24
hours
one’s
ability
to
do
simple
math
is
greatly
impaired
Driving
tired
has
been
shown
to
be
as
bad
as
driving
drunk
Moods
change
depression
anxiety
and
mania
can
be
induced
by
lack
of
sleep
As
much
as
people
try
to
do
without
enough
sleep
it
is
a
wonder
more
crazy
things
don’t
happen
in
this
world
She
nervously
peered
over
the
edge
She
understood
in
her
mind
that
the
view
was
supposed
to
be
beautiful
but
all
she
felt
was
fear
There
had
always
been
something
about
heights
that
disturbed
her
and
now
she
could
feel
the
full
force
of
this
unease
She
reluctantly
crept
a
little
closer
with
the
encouragement
of
her
friends
as
the
fear
continued
to
build
She
couldn`t
help
but
feel
that
something
horrible
was
about
to
happen
The
opened
package
of
potato
chips
held
the
answer
to
the
mystery
Both
detectives
looked
at
it
but
failed
to
realize
it
was
the
key
to
solve
the
crime
They
passed
by
it
assuming
it
was
random
trash
ensuring
that
the
case
would
never
be
solved
It
all
started
with
a
random
letter
Several
of
those
were
joined
forces
to
create
a
random
word
The
words
decided
to
get
together
and
form
a
random
sentence
They
decided
not
to
stop
there
and
it
wasn`t
long
before
a
random
paragraph
had
been
cobbled
together
The
question
was
whether
or
not
they
could
continue
the
momentum
long
enough
to
create
a
random
short
story
Terrance
knew
that
sometimes
it
was
simply
best
to
stay
out
of
it
He
kept
repeating
this
to
himself
as
he
watched
the
scene
unfold
He
knew
that
nothing
good
would
come
of
him
getting
involved
It
was
far
better
for
him
to
stay
on
the
sidelines
and
observe
He
kept
yelling
this
to
himself
inside
his
head
as
he
walked
over
to
the
couple
and
punched
the
man
in
the
face
She
glanced
up
into
the
sky
to
watch
the
clouds
taking
shape
First
she
saw
a
dog
Next
it
was
an
elephant
Finally
she
saw
a
giant
umbrella
and
at
that
moment
the
rain
began
to
pour
The
paper
was
blank
It
shouldn`t
have
been
There
should
have
been
writing
on
the
paper
at
least
a
paragraph
if
not
more
The
fact
that
the
writing
wasn`t
there
was
frustrating
Actually
it
was
even
more
than
frustrating
It
was
downright
distressing
No
matter
how
hard
he
tried
he
couldn`t
give
her
a
good
explanation
about
what
had
happened
It
didn`t
even
really
make
sense
to
him
All
he
knew
was
that
he
froze
at
the
moment
and
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
to
react
nothing
in
his
body
allowed
him
to
move
It
was
as
if
he
had
instantly
become
a
statue
and
although
he
could
see
what
was
taking
place
he
couldn`t
move
to
intervene
He
knew
that
wasn`t
a
satisfactory
explanation
even
though
it
was
the
truth
The
picket
fence
had
stood
for
years
without
any
issue
That`s
all
it
was
simple
white
picket
fence
Why
it
had
all
of
a
sudden
become
a
lightning
rod
within
the
community
was
still
unbelievable
to
most
Yet
a
community
that
had
once
lived
in
harmony
was
now
divided
in
bitter
hatred
and
it
had
everything
to
do
with
the
white
picket
fence
It
was
difficult
for
him
to
admit
he
was
wrong
He
had
been
so
certain
that
he
was
correct
and
the
deeply
held
belief
could
never
be
shaken
Yet
the
proof
that
he
had
been
incorrect
stood
right
before
his
eyes
See
daddy
I
told
you
that
they
are
real
his
daughter
excitedly
proclaimed
The
boxed
moved
That
was
a
problem
Peter
had
packed
the
box
three
hours
before
and
there
was
nothing
inside
that
should
make
it
move
The
question
now
was
whether
or
not
Peter
was
going
to
open
it
up
and
look
inside
to
see
why
it
had
moved
The
answer
to
that
question
was
obvious
Peter
dropped
the
package
into
the
mailbox
so
he
would
never
have
to
see
it
again
He
scolded
himself
for
being
so
tentative
He
knew
he
shouldn`t
be
so
cautious
but
there
was
a
sixth
sense
telling
him
that
things
weren`t
exactly
as
they
appeared
It
was
that
weird
chill
that
rolls
up
your
neck
and
makes
the
hair
stand
on
end
He
knew
that
being
so
tentative
could
end
up
costing
him
the
job
but
he
learned
that
listening
to
his
sixth
sense
usually
kept
him
from
getting
into
a
lot
of
trouble
There
wasn`t
a
whole
lot
he
could
do
at
that
moment
He
played
the
situation
again
and
again
in
his
head
looking
at
what
he
might
have
done
differently
to
make
the
situation
better
No
matter
how
many
times
he
relived
the
situation
in
his
head
there
was
never
really
a
good
alternative
course
of
action
There
simply
wasn`t
a
whole
lot
he
could
have
done
in
that
particular
moment
The
thing
that`s
great
about
this
job
is
the
time
sourcing
the
items
involves
no
traveling
I
just
look
online
to
buy
it
It`s
really
as
simple
as
that
While
everyone
else
is
searching
for
what
they
can
sell
I
sit
in
front
of
my
computer
and
buy
better
stuff
for
less
money
and
spend
a
fraction
of
the
time
doing
it
The
lone
lamp
post
of
the
one-street
town
flickered
not
quite
dead
but
definitely
on
its
way
out
Suitcase
by
her
side
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
light
the
street
or
the
town
car
was
coming
down
the
street
and
with
her
arm
outstretched
and
thumb
in
the
air
she
had
a
plan
He
sat
across
from
her
trying
to
imagine
it
was
the
first
time
It
wasn`t
Had
it
been
a
hundred
It
quite
possibly
could
have
been
Two
hundred
Probably
not
His
mind
wandered
until
he
caught
himself
and
again
tried
to
imagine
it
was
the
first
time
There
was
nothing
to
indicate
Nancy
was
going
to
change
the
world
She
looked
like
an
average
girl
going
to
an
average
high
school
It
was
the
fact
that
everything
about
her
seemed
average
that
would
end
up
becoming
her
superpower
Since
they
are
still
preserved
in
the
rocks
for
us
to
see
they
must
have
been
formed
quite
recently
that
is
geologically
speaking
What
can
explain
these
striations
and
their
common
orientation
Did
you
ever
hear
about
the
Great
Ice
Age
or
the
Pleistocene
Epoch
Less
than
one
million
years
ago
in
fact
some
12
000
years
ago
an
ice
sheet
many
thousands
of
feet
thick
rode
over
Burke
Mountain
in
a
southeastward
direction
The
many
boulders
frozen
to
the
underside
of
the
ice
sheet
tended
to
scratch
the
rocks
over
which
they
rode
The
scratches
or
striations
seen
in
the
park
rocks
were
caused
by
these
attached
boulders
The
ice
sheet
also
plucked
and
rounded
Burke
Mountain
into
the
shape
it
possesses
today
I
inadvertently
went
to
See`s
Candy
last
week
I
was
in
the
mall
looking
for
phone
repair
and
as
it
turns
out
See`s
Candy
now
charges
a
dollar
--
a
full
dollar
--
for
even
the
simplest
of
their
wee
confection
offerings
I
bought
two
chocolate
lollipops
and
two
chocolate-caramel-almond
things
The
total
cost
was
four-something
I
mean
the
candies
were
tasty
and
all
but
let`s
be
real
Snickers
bar
is
fifty
cents
After
this
dollar-per-candy
revelation
I
may
not
find
myself
wandering
dreamily
back
into
a
See`s
Candy
any
time
soon
Don`t
be
scared
The
things
out
there
that
are
unknown
aren`t
scary
in
themselves
They
are
just
unknown
at
the
moment
Take
the
time
to
know
them
before
you
list
them
as
scary
Then
the
world
will
be
a
much
less
scary
place
for
you
Debbie
knew
she
was
being
selfish
and
unreasonable
She
understood
why
the
others
in
the
room
were
angry
and
frustrated
with
her
and
the
way
she
was
acting
In
her
eyes
it
didn`t
really
matter
how
they
felt
because
she
simply
didn`t
care
It
was
just
a
burger
Why
couldn`t
she
understand
that
She
knew
he`d
completely
changed
his
life
around
her
eating
habits
so
why
couldn`t
she
give
him
a
break
this
one
time
She
wasn`t
even
supposed
to
have
found
out
Yes
he
had
promised
her
and
yes
he
had
broken
that
promise
but
still
in
his
mind
all
it
had
been
was
just
a
burger
There
were
only
two
ways
to
get
out
of
this
mess
if
they
all
worked
together
The
problem
was
that
neither
was
all
that
appealing
One
would
likely
cause
everyone
a
huge
amount
of
physical
pain
while
the
other
would
likely
end
up
with
everyone
in
jail
In
Sam`s
mind
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
He
threw
everyone
else
under
the
bus
and
he
secretly
sprinted
away
leaving
the
others
to
take
the
fall
without
him
He
lifted
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
took
a
sip
of
the
drink
He
had
tasted
this
before
but
he
couldn`t
quite
remember
the
time
and
place
it
had
happened
He
desperately
searched
his
mind
trying
to
locate
and
remember
where
he
had
tasted
this
when
the
bicycle
ran
over
his
foot
Benny
was
tired
Not
the
normal
every
day
tired
from
a
hard
day
work
The
exhausted
type
of
tired
where
you`re
surprised
your
body
can
even
move
All
he
wanted
to
do
was
sit
in
front
of
the
TV
put
his
feet
up
on
the
coffee
table
and
drink
a
beer
The
only
issue
was
that
he
had
forgotten
where
he
lived
Brenda
never
wanted
to
be
famous
While
most
of
her
friends
dreamed
about
being
famous
she
could
see
the
negative
aspects
that
those
who
wanted
to
be
famous
seemed
to
ignore
The
fact
that
you
could
never
do
anything
in
public
without
being
mobbed
and
the
complete
lack
of
privacy
was
something
that
she
never
wanted
to
experience
She
also
had
no
desire
to
have
strangers
speculating
about
every
aspect
of
her
life
and
what
each
thing
she
did
was
supposed
to
mean
Brenda
was
perfectly
happy
with
her
anonymous
life
where
she
could
do
exactly
as
she
wanted
without
anyone
else
giving
a
damn
Thus
her
overnight
Internet
celebrity
was
not
something
she
was
thrilled
about
as
her
friends
told
her
how
lucky
she
was
There
weren`t
supposed
to
be
dragons
flying
in
the
sky
First
and
foremost
dragons
didn`t
exist
They
were
mythical
creatures
from
fantasy
books
like
unicorns
This
was
something
that
Pete
knew
in
his
heart
to
be
true
so
he
was
having
a
difficult
time
acknowledging
that
there
were
actually
fire-breathing
dragons
flying
in
the
sky
above
him
Dave
found
joy
in
the
daily
routine
of
life
He
awoke
at
the
same
time
ate
the
same
breakfast
and
drove
the
same
commute
He
worked
at
a
job
that
never
seemed
to
change
and
he
got
home
at
pm
sharp
every
night
It
was
who
he
had
been
for
the
last
ten
years
and
he
had
no
idea
that
was
all
about
to
change
He
took
a
sip
of
the
drink
He
wasn`t
sure
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
but
at
this
moment
it
didn`t
matter
She
had
made
it
especially
for
him
so
he
would
have
forced
it
down
even
if
he
had
absolutely
hated
it
That`s
simply
the
way
things
worked
She
made
him
a
new-fangled
drink
each
day
and
he
took
a
sip
of
it
and
smiled
saying
it
was
excellent
She`s
asked
the
question
so
many
times
that
she
barely
listened
to
the
answers
anymore
The
answers
were
always
the
same
Well
not
exactly
the
same
but
the
same
in
a
general
sense
more
accurate
description
was
the
answers
never
surprised
her
So
she
asked
for
the
10
000th
time
What`s
your
favorite
animal
But
this
time
was
different
When
she
heard
the
young
boy`s
answer
she
wondered
if
she
had
heard
him
correctly
There
was
something
special
about
this
little
creature
Donna
couldn`t
quite
pinpoint
what
it
was
but
she
knew
with
all
her
heart
that
it
was
true
It
wasn`t
a
matter
of
if
she
was
going
to
try
and
save
it
but
a
matter
of
how
she
was
going
to
save
it
She
went
back
to
the
car
to
get
a
blanket
and
when
she
returned
the
creature
was
gone
Twenty
seconds
were
all
that
was
left
and
Richard
could
hear
each
one
tick
by
Fifteen
seconds
now
remained
and
the
panic
began
to
fully
set
in
Ten
seconds
and
he
wasn`t
sure
he
had
enough
time
Five
seconds
four
three
two
one
Housework
could
be
everyone’s
work
not
just
women’s
work”
Why
do
women
enable
men
to
act
oblivious
to
cleaning
grocery
shopping
pet
feeding
etc
Somehow
when
men
live
alone
they
figure
out
how
to
do
all
of
those
things
all
on
their
own
My
friend’s
husband
claimed
he
didn’t
know
that
sheets
should
be
washed
more
than
once
a
season
He
said
he
didn’t
know
one
had
to
clean
toilets
He
assumed
that
since
you
flush
toilets
they
clean
themselves
She
tried
to
get
him
to
help
but
he
did
an
awful
job
so
she
let
him
off
the
hook
Wouldn’t
it
be
better
if
she
spent
the
time
and
energy
to
get
him
to
do
it
right
instead
of
letting
him
claim
he
is
just
bad
at
it”
My
sons
were
raised
to
clean
toilets
and
change
their
own
sheets
Hopefully
in
their
future
homes
the
housework
will
be
equally
divided
She
wondered
if
the
note
had
reached
him
She
scolded
herself
for
not
handing
it
to
him
in
person
She
trusted
her
friend
but
so
much
could
happen
She
waited
impatiently
for
word
I
guess
we
could
discuss
the
implications
of
the
phrase
meant
to
be
That
is
if
we
wanted
to
drown
ourselves
in
a
sea
of
backwardly
referential
semantics
and
other
mumbo-jumbo
Maybe
such
a
discussion
would
result
in
the
determination
that
meant
to
be
is
exactly
as
meaningless
a
phrase
as
it
seems
to
be
and
that
none
of
us
is
actually
meant
to
be
doing
anything
at
all
But
that`s
my
existential
underpants
underpinnings
showing
It`s
the
way
the
cookie
crumbles
And
now
I
want
a
cookie
She
tried
not
to
judge
him
His
ratty
clothes
and
unkempt
hair
made
him
look
homeless
Was
he
really
the
next
Einstein
as
she
had
been
told
On
the
off
chance
it
was
true
she
continued
to
try
not
to
judge
him
The
headphones
were
on
They
had
been
utilized
on
purpose
She
could
hear
her
mom
yelling
in
the
background
but
couldn`t
make
out
exactly
what
the
yelling
was
about
That
was
exactly
why
she
had
put
them
on
She
knew
her
mom
would
enter
her
room
at
any
minute
and
she
could
pretend
that
she
hadn`t
heard
any
of
the
previous
yelling
After
hunting
for
several
hours
we
finally
saw
a
large
seal
sunning
itself
on
a
flat
rock
I
took
one
of
the
wooden
clubs
while
Larry
took
the
longer
one
We
slowly
snuck
up
behind
the
seal
until
we
were
close
enough
to
club
it
over
its
head
The
seal
slumped
over
and
died
This
seal
would
help
us
survive
We
could
eat
the
meat
and
fat
The
fat
could
be
burned
in
a
shell
for
light
and
the
fur
could
be
used
to
make
a
blanket
We
declared
our
first
day
of
hunting
a
great
success
He
was
an
expert
but
not
in
a
discipline
that
anyone
could
fully
appreciate
He
knew
how
to
hold
the
cone
just
right
so
that
the
soft
server
ice-cream
fell
into
it
at
the
precise
angle
to
form
a
perfect
cone
each
and
every
time
It
had
taken
years
to
perfect
and
he
could
now
do
it
without
even
putting
any
thought
behind
it
Nobody
seemed
to
fully
understand
the
beauty
of
this
accomplishment
except
for
the
new
worker
who
watched
in
amazement
He
wandered
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
basement
The
damp
musty
smell
of
unuse
hung
in
the
air
single
small
window
let
in
a
glimmer
of
light
but
this
simply
made
the
shadows
in
the
basement
deeper
He
inhaled
deeply
and
looked
around
at
a
mess
that
had
been
accumulating
for
over
25
years
He
was
positive
that
this
was
the
place
he
wanted
to
live
There
was
something
in
the
sky
What
exactly
was
up
there
wasn`t
immediately
clear
But
there
was
definitely
something
in
the
sky
and
it
was
getting
bigger
and
bigger
He
sat
staring
at
the
person
in
the
train
stopped
at
the
station
going
in
the
opposite
direction
She
sat
staring
ahead
never
noticing
that
she
was
being
watched
Both
trains
began
to
move
and
he
knew
that
in
another
timeline
or
in
another
universe
they
had
been
happy
together
Debbie
had
taken
George
for
granted
for
more
than
fifteen
years
now
He
wasn`t
sure
what
exactly
had
made
him
choose
this
time
and
place
to
address
the
issue
but
he
decided
that
now
was
the
time
He
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
and
just
as
she
was
about
to
speak
turned
away
and
walked
out
the
door
Another
option
you
have
is
choosing
the
number
of
syllables
in
the
words
you
speak
You
probably
have
never
considered
this
option
before
but
you
have
it
every
time
you
open
your
mouth
and
speak
You
make
so
many
choices
like
this
that
you
never
even
think
about
but
you
have
the
choice
with
each
one
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
knowledge
The
drug
seekers
would
come
into
the
emergency
room
and
scream
about
how
much
pain
they
were
in
When
you
told
them
that
you
would
start
elevating
their
pain
with
Tylenol
or
Advil
instead
of
a
narcotic
they
became
nasty
and
combative
They
would
start
telling
you
what
drug
and
dose
they
had
to
have
to
make
their
pain
tolerable
After
dealing
with
the
same
drug
seekers
several
times
a
month
it
gets
old
Some
of
the
doctors
would
give
in
and
give
them
a
dose
of
morphine
and
send
them
away
Sure
that
was
faster
but
ethically
she
still
couldn’t
do
it
Perhaps
that’s
why
she
had
longer
care
times
than
the
other
doctors
Out
of
another
I
get
a
lovely
view
of
the
bay
and
a
little
private
wharf
belonging
to
the
estate
There
is
a
beautiful
shaded
lane
that
runs
down
there
from
the
house
I
always
fancy
I
see
people
walking
in
these
numerous
paths
and
arbors
but
John
has
cautioned
me
not
to
give
way
to
fancy
in
the
least
He
says
that
with
my
imaginative
power
and
habit
of
story-making
a
nervous
weakness
like
mine
is
sure
to
lead
to
all
manner
of
excited
fancies
and
that
I
ought
to
use
my
will
and
good
sense
to
check
the
tendency
So
I
try
The
trees
therefore
must
be
such
old
and
primitive
techniques
that
they
thought
nothing
of
them
deeming
them
so
inconsequential
that
even
savages
like
us
would
know
of
them
and
not
be
suspicious
At
that
they
probably
didn`t
have
too
much
time
after
they
detected
us
orbiting
and
intending
to
land
And
if
that
were
true
there
could
be
only
one
place
where
their
civilization
was
hidden
She
asked
the
question
even
though
she
didn`t
really
want
to
hear
the
answer
It
was
a
no-win
situation
since
she
already
knew
If
he
told
the
truth
she`d
get
confirmation
of
her
worst
fears
If
he
lied
she`d
know
that
he
wasn`t
who
she
thought
he
was
which
would
be
almost
as
bad
Yet
she
asked
the
question
anyway
and
waited
for
his
answer
It
was
cloudy
outside
but
not
really
raining
There
was
a
light
sprinkle
at
most
and
there
certainly
wasn`t
a
need
for
an
umbrella
This
hadn`t
stopped
Sarah
from
pulling
her
umbrella
out
and
opening
it
It
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
weather
or
the
potential
rain
later
that
day
Sarah
used
the
umbrella
to
hide
The
spot
was
perfect
for
camouflage
At
least
that`s
what
she
thought
when
she
picked
the
spot
She
couldn`t
imagine
that
anyone
would
ever
be
able
to
see
her
in
these
surroundings
So
there
she
sat
confident
that
she
was
hidden
from
the
world
and
safe
from
danger
Unfortunately
she
had
not
anticipated
that
others
may
be
looking
upon
her
from
other
angles
and
now
they
were
stealthily
descending
toward
her
hiding
spot
It
was
a
scrape
that
he
hardly
noticed
Sure
there
was
a
bit
of
blood
but
it
was
minor
compared
to
most
of
the
other
cuts
and
bruises
he
acquired
on
his
adventures
There
was
no
way
he
could
know
that
the
rock
that
produced
the
cut
had
alien
genetic
material
on
it
that
was
now
racing
through
his
bloodstream
He
felt
perfectly
normal
and
continued
his
adventure
with
no
knowledge
of
what
was
about
to
happen
to
him
How
had
she
been
so
wrong
All
her
instincts
and
intuition
completely
failed
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
She
had
so
heavily
relied
on
both
when
making
decisions
up
until
this
moment
and
she
felt
a
seismic
shift
take
place
in
her
self-confidence
If
she
could
be
so
completely
wrong
about
something
so
simple
as
this
how
could
she
make
decisions
about
really
important
things
taking
place
in
her
life
She
wasn`t
sure
what
she
should
do
next
Dragons
don`t
exist
they
said
They
are
the
stuff
of
legend
and
people`s
imagination
Greg
would
have
agreed
with
this
assessment
without
a
second
thought
24
hours
ago
But
now
that
there
was
a
dragon
staring
directly
into
his
eyes
he
questioned
everything
that
he
had
been
told
Dave
watched
as
the
forest
burned
up
on
the
hill
only
a
few
miles
from
her
house
The
car
had
been
hastily
packed
and
Marta
was
inside
trying
to
round
up
the
last
of
the
pets
Dave
went
through
his
mental
list
of
the
most
important
papers
and
documents
that
they
couldn`t
leave
behind
He
scolded
himself
for
not
having
prepared
these
better
in
advance
and
hoped
that
he
had
remembered
everything
that
was
needed
He
continued
to
wait
for
Marta
to
appear
with
the
pets
but
she
still
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
There
wasn`t
a
whole
lot
more
that
could
be
done
It
had
become
a
wait-and-see
situation
with
the
final
results
no
longer
in
her
control
That
didn`t
stop
her
from
trying
to
control
the
situation
She
demanded
that
things
be
done
as
she
desperately
tried
to
control
what
couldn`t
be
Patricia`s
friend
who
was
here
hardly
had
any
issues
at
all
but
she
wasn`t
telling
the
truth
Yesterday
before
she
left
to
go
home
she
heard
that
her
husband
is
in
the
hospital
and
pretended
to
be
surprised
It
later
came
out
that
she
was
the
person
who
had
put
him
there
She
had
been
an
angel
for
coming
up
on
10
years
and
in
all
that
time
nobody
had
told
her
this
was
possible
The
fact
that
it
could
ever
happen
never
even
entered
her
mind
Yet
there
she
stood
with
the
undeniable
evidence
sitting
on
the
ground
before
her
Angels
could
lose
their
wings
It
was
that
terrifying
feeling
you
have
as
you
tightly
hold
the
covers
over
you
with
the
knowledge
that
there
is
something
hiding
under
your
bed
You
want
to
look
but
you
don`t
at
the
same
time
You`re
frozen
with
fear
and
unable
to
act
That`s
where
she
found
herself
and
she
didn`t
know
what
to
do
next
The
bowl
was
filled
with
fruit
It
seemed
to
be
an
overabundance
of
strawberries
but
it
also
included
blueberries
raspberries
grapes
and
banana
slices
This
was
the
meal
Sarah
had
every
morning
to
start
her
day
since
she
could
remember
Why
she
decided
to
add
chocolate
as
an
option
today
was
still
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
she
had
been
in
the
process
of
deciding
she
wanted
to
change
her
routine
This
was
a
baby
step
to
begin
that
start
It
seemed
like
it
should
have
been
so
simple
There
was
nothing
inherently
difficult
with
getting
the
project
done
It
was
simple
and
straightforward
enough
that
even
a
child
should
have
been
able
to
complete
it
on
time
but
that
wasn`t
the
case
The
deadline
had
arrived
and
the
project
remained
unfinished
His
mother
had
always
taught
him
not
to
ever
think
of
himself
as
better
than
others
He`d
tried
to
live
by
this
motto
He
never
looked
down
on
those
who
were
less
fortunate
or
who
had
less
money
than
him
But
the
stupidity
of
the
group
of
people
he
was
talking
to
made
him
change
his
mind
The
answer
was
within
her
reach
It
was
hidden
in
a
box
and
now
that
box
sat
directly
in
front
of
her
She`d
spent
years
searching
for
it
and
could
hardly
believe
she`d
finally
managed
to
find
it
She
turned
the
key
to
unlock
the
box
and
then
gently
lifted
the
top
She
held
her
breath
in
anticipation
of
finally
knowing
the
answer
she
had
spent
so
much
of
her
time
in
search
of
As
the
lid
came
off
she
could
see
that
the
box
was
empty
I`ll
talk
to
you
tomorrow
in
more
detail
at
our
meeting
but
I
think
I`ve
found
a
solution
to
our
problem
It`s
not
exactly
legal
but
it
won`t
land
us
in
jail
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
either
Are
you
willing
to
take
the
chance
Monroe
asked
his
partner
over
the
phone
It
wasn`t
quite
yet
time
to
panic
There
was
still
time
to
salvage
the
situation
At
least
that
is
what
she
was
telling
himself
The
reality
was
that
it
was
time
to
panic
and
there
wasn`t
time
to
salvage
the
situation
but
he
continued
to
delude
himself
into
believing
there
was
There
wasn`t
a
whole
lot
more
that
could
be
done
It
had
become
a
wait-and-see
situation
with
the
final
results
no
longer
in
her
control
That
didn`t
stop
her
from
trying
to
control
the
situation
She
demanded
that
things
be
done
as
she
desperately
tried
to
control
what
couldn`t
be
It
really
didn`t
matter
what
they
did
to
him
He`s
already
made
up
his
mind
Whatever
came
his
way
he
was
prepared
for
the
consequences
He
knew
in
his
heart
that
the
sacrifice
he
made
was
done
with
love
and
not
hate
no
matter
how
others
decided
to
spin
it
He
hid
under
the
covers
hoping
that
nobody
would
notice
him
there
It
really
didn`t
make
much
sense
since
it
would
be
obvious
to
anyone
who
walked
into
the
room
there
was
someone
hiding
there
but
he
still
held
out
hope
He
heard
footsteps
coming
down
the
hall
and
stop
in
front
in
front
of
the
bedroom
door
He
heard
the
squeak
of
the
door
hinges
and
someone
opened
the
bedroom
door
He
held
his
breath
waiting
for
whoever
was
about
to
discover
him
but
they
never
did
It`s
not
his
fault
I
know
you`re
going
to
want
to
but
you
can`t
blame
him
He
really
has
no
idea
how
it
happened
I
kept
trying
to
come
up
with
excuses
I
could
say
to
mom
that
would
keep
her
calm
when
she
found
out
what
happened
but
the
more
I
tried
the
more
I
could
see
none
of
them
would
work
He
was
going
to
get
her
wrath
and
there
was
nothing
I
could
say
to
prevent
it
Ingredients
for
life
said
the
backside
of
the
truck
They
mean
food
but
really
food
is
only
ingredient
of
life
Life
has
so
many
more
ingredients
such
as
pain
happiness
laughter
joy
tears
and
smiles
Life
also
has
hard
work
easy
play
sleepless
nights
and
sunbathing
by
the
ocean
Love
hatred
envy
self-assurance
and
fear
could
be
just
down
aisle
ready
to
be
bought
when
needed
How
I
wish
I
could
pull
ingredients
like
these
off
shelves
in
a
store
At
that
moment
she
realized
that
she
had
created
her
current
life
It
wasn`t
the
life
she
wanted
but
she
took
responsibility
for
how
it
currently
stood
Something
clicked
and
she
saw
that
every
choice
she
made
to
this
point
in
her
life
had
led
to
where
her
life
stood
at
this
very
moment
even
if
she
knew
this
wasn`t
where
she
wanted
to
be
She
determined
to
choose
to
change
it
The
cab
arrived
late
The
inside
was
in
as
bad
of
shape
as
the
outside
which
was
concerning
and
it
didn`t
appear
that
it
had
been
cleaned
in
months
The
green
tree
air-freshener
hanging
from
the
rearview
mirror
was
either
exhausted
of
its
scent
or
not
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
other
odors
emitting
from
the
cab
The
correct
decision
in
this
case
was
to
get
the
hell
out
of
it
and
to
call
another
cab
but
she
was
late
and
didn`t
have
a
choice
I`m
heading
back
to
Colorado
tomorrow
after
being
down
in
Santa
Barbara
over
the
weekend
for
the
festival
there
I
will
be
making
October
plans
once
there
and
will
try
to
arrange
so
I`m
back
here
for
the
birthday
if
possible
I`ll
let
you
know
as
soon
as
I
know
the
doctor`s
appointment
schedule
and
my
flight
plans
I`m
so
confused
by
your
ridiculous
meltdown
that
I
must
insist
on
some
sort
of
explanation
for
your
behavior
towards
me
It
just
doesn`t
make
any
sense
There`s
no
way
that
I
deserved
the
treatment
you
gave
me
without
an
explanation
or
an
apology
for
how
out
of
line
you
have
been
It
was
a
good
idea
At
least
they
all
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
at
the
time
Hindsight
would
reveal
that
in
reality
it
was
an
unbelievably
terrible
idea
but
it
would
take
another
week
for
them
to
understand
that
Right
now
at
this
very
moment
they
all
agreed
that
it
was
the
perfect
course
of
action
for
the
current
situation
You
can
decide
what
you
want
to
do
in
life
but
I
suggest
doing
something
that
creates
Something
that
leaves
a
tangible
thing
once
you`re
done
That
way
even
after
you`re
gone
you
will
still
live
on
in
the
things
you
created
The
trail
to
the
left
had
a
Danger
Do
Not
Pass
sign
telling
people
to
take
the
trail
to
the
right
This
wasn`t
the
way
Zeke
approached
his
hiking
Rather
than
a
warning
Zeke
read
the
sign
as
an
invitation
to
explore
an
area
that
would
be
adventurous
and
exciting
As
the
others
in
the
group
all
shited
to
the
right
Zeke
slipped
past
the
danger
sign
to
begin
an
adventure
he
would
later
regret
I
haven`t
bailed
on
writing
Look
I`m
generating
a
random
paragraph
at
this
very
moment
in
an
attempt
to
get
my
writing
back
on
track
I
am
making
an
effort
I
will
start
writing
consistently
again
It
had
been
a
simple
realization
that
had
changed
Debra`s
life
perspective
It
was
really
so
simple
that
she
was
embarrassed
that
she
had
lived
the
previous
five
years
with
the
way
she
measured
her
worth
Now
that
she
saw
what
she
had
been
doing
she
could
see
how
sad
it
was
That
made
her
all
the
more
relieved
she
had
made
the
change
The
number
of
hearts
her
Instagram
posts
received
wasn`t
any
longer
the
indication
of
her
own
self-worth
Sometimes
it`s
the
first
moment
of
the
day
that
catches
you
off
guard
That`s
what
Wendy
was
thinking
She
opened
her
window
to
see
fire
engines
screeching
down
the
street
While
this
wasn`t
something
completely
unheard
of
it
also
wasn`t
normal
It
was
a
sure
sign
of
what
was
going
to
happen
that
day
She
could
feel
it
in
her
bones
and
it
wasn`t
the
way
she
wanted
the
day
to
begin
It
was
going
to
rain
The
weather
forecast
didn`t
say
that
but
the
steel
plate
in
his
hip
did
He
had
learned
over
the
years
to
trust
his
hip
over
the
weatherman
It
was
going
to
rain
so
he
better
get
outside
and
prepare
The
kids
were
loud
They
were
way
too
loud
for
Jerry
especially
since
this
was
a
four-hour
flight
The
parents
didn`t
seem
to
be
able
or
simply
didn`t
want
to
control
them
They
were
yelling
and
fighting
among
themselves
and
it
was
impossible
for
any
of
the
passengers
to
concentrate
or
rest
He
thought
about
politely
tapping
on
the
parents`
shoulders
and
asking
them
to
try
and
get
their
kids
under
a
bit
more
control
but
before
he
did
he
came
up
with
a
better
idea
Sure
it
was
a
bit
sinister
and
he`d
probably
end
in
a
lot
of
trouble
but
he
really
didn`t
care
at
that
point
It
was
a
question
of
which
of
the
two
she
preferred
On
the
one
hand
the
choice
seemed
simple
The
more
expensive
one
with
a
brand
name
would
be
the
choice
of
most
It
was
the
easy
choice
The
safe
choice
But
she
wasn`t
sure
she
actually
preferred
it
The
young
man
wanted
a
role
model
He
looked
long
and
hard
in
his
youth
but
that
role
model
never
materialized
His
only
choice
was
to
embrace
all
the
people
in
his
life
he
didn`t
want
to
be
like
The
box
sat
on
the
desk
next
to
the
computer
It
had
arrived
earlier
in
the
day
and
business
had
interrupted
her
opening
it
earlier
She
didn`t
who
had
sent
it
and
briefly
wondered
who
it
might
have
been
As
she
began
to
unwrap
it
she
had
no
idea
that
opening
it
would
completely
change
her
life
This
is
important
to
remember
Love
isn`t
like
pie
You
don`t
need
to
divide
it
among
all
your
friends
and
loved
ones
No
matter
how
much
love
you
give
you
can
always
give
more
It
doesn`t
run
out
so
don`t
try
to
hold
back
giving
it
as
if
it
may
one
day
run
out
Give
it
freely
and
as
much
as
you
want
There
was
little
doubt
that
the
bridge
was
unsafe
All
one
had
to
do
was
look
at
it
to
know
that
with
certainty
Yet
Bob
didn`t
see
another
option
He
may
have
been
able
to
work
one
out
if
he
had
a
bit
of
time
to
think
things
through
but
time
was
something
he
didn`t
have
choice
needed
to
be
made
and
it
needed
to
be
made
quickly
Sleeping
in
his
car
was
never
the
plan
but
sometimes
things
don`t
work
out
as
planned
This
had
been
his
life
for
the
last
three
months
and
he
was
just
beginning
to
get
used
to
it
He
didn`t
actually
enjoy
it
but
he
had
accepted
it
and
come
to
terms
with
it
Or
at
least
he
thought
he
had
All
that
changed
when
he
put
the
key
into
the
ignition
turned
it
and
the
engine
didn`t
make
a
sound
Mary
had
to
make
a
decision
and
she
knew
that
whatever
decision
she
made
it
would
upset
someone
It
seemed
like
such
a
silly
reason
for
people
to
get
upset
but
she
knew
the
minute
that
she
began
to
consider
doing
it
that
there
was
no
way
everyone
in
her
life
would
be
pleased
with
what
she
ultimately
decided
to
do
It
was
simply
a
question
of
who
she
would
rather
displease
most
While
this
had
always
been
her
parents
and
especially
her
mom
in
the
past
that
she
tried
to
keep
from
upsetting
she
decided
that
this
time
the
person
she
was
going
to
please
the
most
with
her
decision
was
herself
The
leather
jacked
showed
the
scars
of
being
his
favorite
for
years
It
wore
those
scars
with
pride
feeling
that
they
enhanced
his
presence
rather
than
diminishing
it
The
scars
gave
it
character
and
had
not
overwhelmed
to
the
point
that
it
had
become
ratty
The
jacket
was
in
its
prime
and
it
knew
it
The
desert
wind
blew
the
tumbleweed
in
front
of
the
car
Alex
swerved
to
avoid
the
tumbleweed
but
he
turned
the
wheel
a
bit
too
strong
and
the
car
left
the
road
and
skidded
onto
the
dirt
median
He
instantly
slammed
on
the
brakes
and
the
car
stopped
in
a
cloud
of
dirt
When
the
dust
cloud
had
settled
and
he
could
see
around
him
again
he
realized
that
he`d
somehow
crossed
over
into
an
entirely
new
dimension
He
collected
the
plastic
trash
on
a
daily
basis
It
never
seemed
to
end
Even
if
he
cleaned
the
entire
beach
more
plastic
would
cover
it
the
next
day
after
the
tide
had
come
in
Although
it
was
a
futile
effort
that
would
never
be
done
he
continued
to
pick
up
the
trash
each
day
There
was
nothing
else
to
do
The
deed
had
already
been
done
and
there
was
no
going
back
It
now
had
been
become
a
question
of
how
they
were
going
to
be
able
to
get
out
of
this
situation
and
escape
She
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
could
tell
a
lot
about
a
person
by
their
ears
The
way
they
stuck
out
and
the
size
of
the
earlobes
could
give
you
wonderful
insights
into
the
person
Of
course
she
couldn`t
scientifically
prove
any
of
this
but
that
didn`t
matter
to
her
Before
anything
else
she
would
size
up
the
ears
of
the
person
she
was
talking
to
He
ordered
his
regular
breakfast
Two
eggs
sunnyside
up
hash
browns
and
two
strips
of
bacon
He
continued
to
look
at
the
menu
wondering
if
this
would
be
the
day
he
added
something
new
This
was
also
part
of
the
routine
few
seconds
of
hesitation
to
see
if
something
else
would
be
added
to
the
order
before
demuring
and
saying
that
would
be
all
It
was
the
same
exact
meal
that
he
had
ordered
every
day
for
the
past
two
years
She
wondered
if
the
note
had
reached
him
She
scolded
herself
for
not
handing
it
to
him
in
person
She
trusted
her
friend
but
so
much
could
happen
She
waited
impatiently
for
word
She
had
been
told
time
and
time
again
that
the
most
important
steps
were
the
first
and
the
last
It
was
something
that
she
carried
within
her
in
everything
she
did
but
then
he
showed
up
and
disrupted
everything
He
told
her
that
she
had
it
wrong
The
first
step
wasn`t
the
most
important
The
last
step
wasn`t
the
most
important
It
was
the
next
step
that
was
the
most
important
He
took
a
sip
of
the
drink
He
wasn`t
sure
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
but
at
this
moment
it
didn`t
matter
She
had
made
it
especially
for
him
so
he
would
have
forced
it
down
even
if
he
had
absolutely
hated
it
That`s
simply
the
way
things
worked
She
made
him
a
new-fangled
drink
each
day
and
he
took
a
sip
of
it
and
smiled
saying
it
was
excellent
Puppies
are
soft
cute
funny
and
make
a
big
mess
Every
month
or
two
our
family
fosters
6-12
week
old
puppies
for
a
puppy
rescue
nonprofit
organization
We
all
enjoy
cuddling
their
furry
bodies
after
a
clean
bath
Fresh
puppy
smell
is
great
The
puppies
play
with
each
other
and
our
adult
dog
They
look
so
funny
when
they
lay
on
top
of
each
other
and
sleep
While
puppies
can
be
great
fun
they
also
can
make
big
messes
4-6
puppies
can
make
a
lot
of
puppy
pee
and
poop
It`s
a
challenge
to
keep
the
puppies
and
the
puppy
pen
clean
He
heard
the
loud
impact
before
he
ever
saw
the
result
It
had
been
so
loud
that
it
had
actually
made
him
jump
back
in
his
seat
As
soon
as
he
recovered
from
the
surprise
he
saw
the
crack
in
the
windshield
It
seemed
to
be
an
analogy
of
the
current
condition
of
his
life
She
never
liked
cleaning
the
sink
It
was
beyond
her
comprehension
how
it
got
so
dirty
so
quickly
It
seemed
that
she
was
forced
to
clean
it
every
other
day
Even
when
she
was
extra
careful
to
keep
things
clean
and
orderly
it
still
ended
up
looking
like
a
mess
in
a
couple
of
days
What
she
didn`t
know
was
there
was
a
tiny
creature
living
in
it
that
didn`t
like
things
neat
The
opened
package
of
potato
chips
held
the
answer
to
the
mystery
Both
detectives
looked
at
it
but
failed
to
realize
it
was
the
key
to
solve
the
crime
They
passed
by
it
assuming
it
was
random
trash
ensuring
that
the
case
would
never
be
solved
It`s
an
unfortunate
reality
that
we
don`t
teach
people
how
to
make
money
beyond
getting
a
to
job
as
part
of
our
education
system
The
truth
is
there
are
a
lot
of
different
legitimate
ways
to
make
money
That
doesn`t
mean
they
are
easy
and
that
you
won`t
have
to
work
hard
to
succeed
but
it
does
mean
that
if
you`re
willing
to
open
your
mind
a
bit
you
don`t
have
to
be
stuck
in
an
office
from
to
for
the
next
fifty
years
your
life
I`m
meant
to
be
writing
at
this
moment
What
I
mean
is
I`m
meant
to
be
writing
something
else
at
this
moment
The
document
I`m
meant
to
be
writing
is
of
course
open
in
another
program
on
my
computer
and
is
patiently
awaiting
my
attention
Yet
here
I
am
plonking
down
senseless
sentiments
in
this
paragraph
because
it`s
easier
to
do
than
to
work
on
anything
particularly
meaningful
I
am
grateful
for
the
distraction
Ten
more
steps
If
he
could
take
ten
more
steps
it
would
be
over
but
his
legs
wouldn`t
move
He
tried
to
will
them
to
work
but
they
wouldn`t
listen
to
his
brain
Ten
more
steps
and
it
would
be
over
but
it
didn`t
appear
he
would
be
able
to
do
it
The
day
had
begun
on
a
bright
note
The
sun
finally
peeked
through
the
rain
for
the
first
time
in
a
week
and
the
birds
were
singing
in
its
warmth
There
was
no
way
to
anticipate
what
was
about
to
happen
It
was
a
worst-case
scenario
and
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
Her
eyebrows
were
a
shade
darker
than
her
hair
They
were
thick
and
almost
horizontal
emphasizing
the
depth
of
her
eyes
She
was
rather
handsome
than
beautiful
Her
face
was
captivating
by
reason
of
a
certain
frankness
of
expression
and
a
contradictory
subtle
play
of
features
Her
manner
was
engaging
The
coin
hovered
in
the
air
spinning
over
and
over
again
It
reached
its
peak
and
began
to
descend
Both
boys
were
pleading
with
it
to
land
a
certain
way
but
the
coin
had
already
made
up
its
mind
on
what
it
was
going
to
do
She
had
been
an
angel
for
coming
up
on
10
years
and
in
all
that
time
nobody
had
told
her
this
was
possible
The
fact
that
it
could
ever
happen
never
even
entered
her
mind
Yet
there
she
stood
with
the
undeniable
evidence
sitting
on
the
ground
before
her
Angels
could
lose
their
wings
It
had
been
her
dream
for
years
but
Dana
had
failed
to
take
any
action
toward
making
it
come
true
There
had
always
been
a
good
excuse
to
delay
or
prioritize
another
project
As
she
woke
she
realized
she
was
once
again
at
a
crossroads
Would
it
be
another
excuse
or
would
she
finally
find
the
courage
to
pursue
her
dream
Dana
rose
and
took
her
first
step
Finding
the
truth
wouldn`t
be
easy
that`s
for
sure
Then
there
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
Jane
really
wanted
to
know
the
truth
That`s
the
thing
that
bothered
her
most
It
wasn`t
the
difficulty
of
actually
finding
out
what
happened
that
was
the
obstacle
but
having
to
live
with
that
information
once
it
was
found
The
lone
lamp
post
of
the
one-street
town
flickered
not
quite
dead
but
definitely
on
its
way
out
Suitcase
by
her
side
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
light
the
street
or
the
town
car
was
coming
down
the
street
and
with
her
arm
outstretched
and
thumb
in
the
air
she
had
a
plan
She
asked
the
question
even
though
she
didn`t
really
want
to
hear
the
answer
It
was
a
no-win
situation
since
she
already
knew
If
he
told
the
truth
she`d
get
confirmation
of
her
worst
fears
If
he
lied
she`d
know
that
he
wasn`t
who
she
thought
he
was
which
would
be
almost
as
bad
Yet
she
asked
the
question
anyway
and
waited
for
his
answer
It
was
supposed
to
be
a
dream
vacation
They
had
planned
it
over
a
year
in
advance
so
that
it
would
be
perfect
in
every
way
It
had
been
what
they
had
been
looking
forward
to
through
all
the
turmoil
and
negativity
around
them
It
had
been
the
light
at
the
end
of
both
their
tunnels
Now
that
the
dream
vacation
was
only
a
week
away
the
virus
had
stopped
all
air
travel
It
wasn`t
quite
yet
time
to
panic
There
was
still
time
to
salvage
the
situation
At
least
that
is
what
she
was
telling
himself
The
reality
was
that
it
was
time
to
panic
and
there
wasn`t
time
to
salvage
the
situation
but
he
continued
to
delude
himself
into
believing
there
was
Benny
was
tired
Not
the
normal
every
day
tired
from
a
hard
day
work
The
exhausted
type
of
tired
where
you`re
surprised
your
body
can
even
move
All
he
wanted
to
do
was
sit
in
front
of
the
TV
put
his
feet
up
on
the
coffee
table
and
drink
a
beer
The
only
issue
was
that
he
had
forgotten
where
he
lived
She
needed
glasses
It
wasn`t
that
she
couldn`t
see
without
them
but
what
she
could
see
with
them
When
she
wore
glasses
her
eyes
focused
so
deeply
that
she
could
see
not
only
the
physical
but
also
beyond
It
was
like
a
superpower
But
she
needed
glasses
There
was
a
time
and
a
place
for
Stephanie
to
use
her
magic
The
problem
was
that
she
had
a
difficult
time
determining
this
She
wished
she
could
simply
use
it
when
the
desire
hit
and
there
wouldn`t
be
any
unforeseen
consequences
Unfortunately
that`s
not
how
it
worked
and
the
consequences
could
be
devastating
if
she
accidentally
used
her
magic
at
the
wrong
time
I
guess
we
could
discuss
the
implications
of
the
phrase
meant
to
be
That
is
if
we
wanted
to
drown
ourselves
in
a
sea
of
backwardly
referential
semantics
and
other
mumbo-jumbo
Maybe
such
a
discussion
would
result
in
the
determination
that
meant
to
be
is
exactly
as
meaningless
a
phrase
as
it
seems
to
be
and
that
none
of
us
is
actually
meant
to
be
doing
anything
at
all
But
that`s
my
existential
underpants
underpinnings
showing
It`s
the
way
the
cookie
crumbles
And
now
I
want
a
cookie
Sometimes
that`s
just
the
way
it
has
to
be
Sure
there
were
probably
other
options
but
he
didn`t
let
them
enter
his
mind
It
was
done
and
that
was
that
It
was
just
the
way
it
had
to
be
There
were
about
twenty
people
on
the
dam
Most
of
them
were
simply
walking
and
getting
exercise
There
were
a
few
who
were
fishing
There
was
a
family
who
had
laid
down
a
blanket
and
they
were
having
a
picnic
It
was
like
this
most
days
and
nothing
seemed
out
of
the
ordinary
The
problem
was
that
nobody
noticed
the
water
leaking
through
the
dam
wall
There
had
to
be
a
better
way
That`s
all
Nancy
could
think
as
she
sat
at
her
desk
staring
at
her
computer
screen
She`d
already
spent
five
years
of
her
life
in
this
little
cubicle
staring
at
her
computer
doing
work
that
didn`t
seem
to
matter
to
anyone
including
her
own
boss
There
had
to
be
more
to
her
life
than
this
and
there
had
to
be
a
better
way
to
make
a
living
That`s
what
she
was
thinking
when
the
earthquake
struck
The
headache
wouldn`t
go
away
She`s
taken
medicine
but
even
that
didn`t
help
The
monstrous
throbbing
in
her
head
continued
She
had
this
happen
to
her
only
once
before
in
her
life
and
she
realized
that
only
one
thing
could
be
happening
Greg
understood
that
this
situation
would
make
Michael
terribly
uncomfortable
Michael
simply
had
no
idea
what
was
about
to
come
and
even
though
Greg
could
prevent
it
from
happening
he
opted
to
let
it
happen
It
was
quite
ironic
really
It
was
something
Greg
had
said
he
would
never
wish
upon
anyone
a
million
times
yet
here
he
was
knowingly
letting
it
happen
to
one
of
his
best
friends
He
rationalized
that
it
would
ultimately
make
Michael
a
better
person
and
that
no
matter
how
uncomfortable
everyone
should
experience
racism
at
least
once
in
their
lifetime
I
recollect
that
my
first
exploit
in
squirrel-shooting
was
in
a
grove
of
tall
walnut-trees
that
shades
one
side
of
the
valley
I
had
wandered
into
it
at
noontime
when
all
nature
is
peculiarly
quiet
and
was
startled
by
the
roar
of
my
own
gun
as
it
broke
the
Sabbath
stillness
around
and
was
prolonged
and
reverberated
by
the
angry
echoes
Turning
away
from
the
ledge
he
started
slowly
down
the
mountain
deciding
that
he
would
that
very
night
satisfy
his
curiosity
about
the
man-house
In
the
meantime
he
would
go
down
into
the
canyon
and
get
a
cool
drink
after
which
he
would
visit
some
berry
patches
just
over
the
ridge
and
explore
among
the
foothills
a
bit
before
his
nap-time
which
always
came
just
after
the
sun
had
walked
past
the
middle
of
the
sky
At
that
period
of
the
day
the
sun’s
warm
rays
seemed
to
cast
a
sleepy
spell
over
the
silent
mountainside
so
all
of
the
animals
with
one
accord
had
decided
it
should
be
the
hour
for
their
mid-day
sleep
He
stepped
away
from
the
mic
This
was
the
best
take
he
had
done
so
far
but
something
seemed
missing
Then
it
struck
him
all
at
once
Visuals
ran
in
front
of
his
eyes
and
music
rang
in
his
ears
His
eager
fingers
went
to
work
in
an
attempt
to
capture
his
thoughts
hoping
the
results
would
produce
something
that
was
at
least
half
their
glory
There
was
something
in
the
tree
It
was
difficult
to
tell
from
the
ground
but
Rachael
could
see
movement
She
squinted
her
eyes
and
peered
in
the
direction
of
the
movement
trying
to
decipher
exactly
what
she
had
spied
The
more
she
peered
however
the
more
she
thought
it
might
be
a
figment
of
her
imagination
Nothing
seemed
to
move
until
the
moment
she
began
to
take
her
eyes
off
the
tree
Then
in
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
would
see
the
movement
again
and
begin
the
process
of
staring
again
The
choice
was
red
green
or
blue
It
didn`t
seem
like
an
important
choice
when
he
was
making
it
but
it
was
a
choice
nonetheless
Had
he
known
the
consequences
at
that
time
he
would
likely
have
considered
the
choice
a
bit
longer
In
the
end
he
didn`t
and
ended
up
choosing
blue
Finding
the
truth
wouldn`t
be
easy
that`s
for
sure
Then
there
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
Jane
really
wanted
to
know
the
truth
That`s
the
thing
that
bothered
her
most
It
wasn`t
the
difficulty
of
actually
finding
out
what
happened
that
was
the
obstacle
but
having
to
live
with
that
information
once
it
was
found
He
stared
out
the
window
at
the
snowy
field
He`d
been
stuck
in
the
house
for
close
to
a
month
and
his
only
view
of
the
outside
world
was
through
the
window
There
wasn`t
much
to
see
It
was
mostly
just
the
field
with
an
occasional
bird
or
small
animal
who
ventured
into
the
field
As
he
continued
to
stare
out
the
window
he
wondered
how
much
longer
he`d
be
shackled
to
the
steel
bar
inside
the
house
His
parents
continued
to
question
him
He
didn`t
know
what
to
say
to
them
since
they
refused
to
believe
the
truth
He
explained
again
and
again
and
they
dismissed
his
explanation
as
a
figment
of
his
imagination
There
was
no
way
that
grandpa
who
had
been
dead
for
five
years
could
have
told
him
where
the
treasure
had
been
hidden
Of
course
it
didn`t
help
that
grandpa
was
roaring
with
laughter
in
the
chair
next
to
him
as
he
tried
to
explain
once
again
how
he`d
found
it
Should
he
write
it
down
That
was
the
question
running
through
his
mind
He
couldn`t
believe
what
had
just
happened
and
he
knew
nobody
else
would
believe
him
as
well
Even
if
he
documented
what
had
happened
by
writing
it
down
he
still
didn`t
believe
anyone
would
still
believe
it
So
the
question
remained
Was
it
be
worth
it
to
actually
write
it
down
He
scolded
himself
for
being
so
tentative
He
knew
he
shouldn`t
be
so
cautious
but
there
was
a
sixth
sense
telling
him
that
things
weren`t
exactly
as
they
appeared
It
was
that
weird
chill
that
rolls
up
your
neck
and
makes
the
hair
stand
on
end
He
knew
that
being
so
tentative
could
end
up
costing
him
the
job
but
he
learned
that
listening
to
his
sixth
sense
usually
kept
him
from
getting
into
a
lot
of
trouble
She`s
asked
the
question
so
many
times
that
she
barely
listened
to
the
answers
anymore
The
answers
were
always
the
same
Well
not
exactly
the
same
but
the
same
in
a
general
sense
more
accurate
description
was
the
answers
never
surprised
her
So
she
asked
for
the
10
000th
time
What`s
your
favorite
animal
But
this
time
was
different
When
she
heard
the
young
boy`s
answer
she
wondered
if
she
had
heard
him
correctly
Do
you
really
listen
when
you
are
talking
with
someone
I
have
a
friend
who
listens
in
an
unforgiving
way
She
actually
takes
every
word
you
say
as
being
something
important
and
when
you
have
a
friend
that
listens
like
that
words
take
on
a
whole
new
meaning
Stormi
is
a
dog
She
is
dark
grey
and
has
long
legs
Her
eyes
are
expressive
and
are
able
to
let
her
humans
know
what
she
is
thinking
Her
tongue
is
long
pink
and
wet
Her
long
legs
allow
her
to
sprint
after
other
dogs
people
or
bunnies
She
can
be
a
good
dog
but
also
very
bad
Her
tail
wags
when
happy
or
excited
and
hides
between
her
back
legs
when
she
is
bad
Stormi
is
a
dog
I
love
There
was
a
time
when
this
wouldn`t
have
bothered
her
The
fact
that
it
did
actually
bother
her
bothered
her
even
more
What
had
changed
in
her
life
that
such
a
small
thing
could
annoy
her
so
much
for
the
entire
day
She
knew
it
was
ridiculous
that
she
even
took
notice
of
it
yet
she
was
still
obsessing
over
it
as
she
tried
to
fall
asleep
There
was
little
doubt
that
the
bridge
was
unsafe
All
one
had
to
do
was
look
at
it
to
know
that
with
certainty
Yet
Bob
didn`t
see
another
option
He
may
have
been
able
to
work
one
out
if
he
had
a
bit
of
time
to
think
things
through
but
time
was
something
he
didn`t
have
choice
needed
to
be
made
and
it
needed
to
be
made
quickly
The
shades
were
closed
keeping
the
room
dark
Peter
knew
that
he
should
open
them
and
let
in
the
sunlight
so
he
could
begin
the
day
but
he
didn`t
have
the
energy
or
willpower
Nothing
had
gone
as
expected
the
day
before
and
he
no
longer
wanted
to
spend
the
energy
to
begin
a
new
day
He
stared
at
the
shades
wondering
if
there
was
a
way
to
disappear
from
the
reality
of
the
world
for
the
rest
of
the
day
He
wandered
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
basement
The
damp
musty
smell
of
unuse
hung
in
the
air
single
small
window
let
in
a
glimmer
of
light
but
this
simply
made
the
shadows
in
the
basement
deeper
He
inhaled
deeply
and
looked
around
at
a
mess
that
had
been
accumulating
for
over
25
years
He
was
positive
that
this
was
the
place
he
wanted
to
live
The
lone
lamp
post
of
the
one-street
town
flickered
not
quite
dead
but
definitely
on
its
way
out
Suitcase
by
her
side
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
light
the
street
or
the
town
car
was
coming
down
the
street
and
with
her
arm
outstretched
and
thumb
in
the
air
she
had
a
plan
She
considered
the
birds
to
be
her
friends
She`d
put
out
food
for
them
each
morning
and
then
she`d
watch
as
they
came
to
the
feeders
to
gorge
themselves
for
the
day
She
wondered
what
they
would
do
if
something
ever
happened
to
her
Would
they
miss
the
meals
she
provided
if
she
failed
to
put
out
the
food
one
morning
The
young
man
wanted
a
role
model
He
looked
long
and
hard
in
his
youth
but
that
role
model
never
materialized
His
only
choice
was
to
embrace
all
the
people
in
his
life
he
didn`t
want
to
be
like
The
wave
crashed
and
hit
the
sandcastle
head-on
The
sandcastle
began
to
melt
under
the
waves
force
and
as
the
wave
receded
half
the
sandcastle
was
gone
The
next
wave
hit
not
quite
as
strong
but
still
managed
to
cover
the
remains
of
the
sandcastle
and
take
more
of
it
away
The
third
wave
a
big
one
crashed
over
the
sandcastle
completely
covering
and
engulfing
it
When
it
receded
there
was
no
trace
the
sandcastle
ever
existed
and
hours
of
hard
work
disappeared
forever
What
have
you
noticed
today
I
noticed
that
if
you
outline
the
eyes
nose
and
mouth
on
your
face
with
your
finger
you
make
an
I
which
makes
perfect
sense
but
is
something
I
never
noticed
before
What
have
you
noticed
today
Where
do
they
get
a
random
paragraph
he
wondered
as
he
clicked
the
generate
button
Do
they
just
write
a
random
paragraph
or
do
they
get
it
somewhere
At
that
moment
he
read
the
random
paragraph
and
realized
it
was
about
random
paragraphs
and
his
world
would
never
be
the
same
The
irony
of
the
situation
hadn`t
escaped
her
She
had
taken
years
to
sculpt
the
perfect
persona
with
the
perfect
look
that
she
shared
on
Instagram
She
knew
her
hundreds
of
thousands
of
followers
envied
that
life
she
showed
and
stayed
engaged
with
her
because
they
wanted
that
life
too
The
truth
was
that
she
wanted
the
perfect
life
she
portrayed
more
than
any
of
her
fans
The
fact
was
that
despite
all
the
perfection
she
shared
on
social
media
her
life
was
actually
more
of
a
mess
than
most
She
closed
her
eyes
and
then
opened
them
again
What
she
was
seeing
just
didn`t
make
sense
She
shook
her
head
seeing
if
that
would
help
It
didn`t
Although
it
seemed
beyond
reality
there
was
no
denying
she
was
witnessing
a
large
formation
of
alien
spaceships
filling
the
sky
It
was
hidden
under
the
log
beside
the
stream
It
had
been
there
for
as
long
as
Jerry
had
been
alive
He
wasn`t
sure
if
anyone
besides
him
and
his
friends
knew
of
its
existence
He
knew
that
anyone
could
potentially
find
it
but
it
was
well
enough
hidden
that
it
seemed
unlikely
to
happen
The
fact
that
it
had
been
there
for
more
than
30
years
attested
to
this
So
it
was
quite
a
surprise
when
he
found
the
item
was
missing
I
haven`t
bailed
on
writing
Look
I`m
generating
a
random
paragraph
at
this
very
moment
in
an
attempt
to
get
my
writing
back
on
track
I
am
making
an
effort
I
will
start
writing
consistently
again
Brock
would
have
never
dared
to
do
it
on
his
own
he
thought
to
himself
That
is
why
Kenneth
and
he
had
become
such
good
friends
Kenneth
forced
Brock
out
of
his
comfort
zone
and
made
him
try
new
things
he`d
never
imagine
doing
otherwise
Up
to
this
point
this
had
been
a
good
thing
It
had
expanded
Brock`s
experiences
and
given
him
a
new
appreciation
for
life
Now
that
both
of
them
were
in
the
back
of
a
police
car
all
Brock
could
think
was
that
he
would
have
never
dared
do
it
except
for
the
influence
of
Kenneth
The
rain
was
coming
Everyone
thought
this
would
be
a
good
thing
It
hadn`t
rained
in
months
and
the
earth
was
dry
as
a
bone
It
wasn`t
a
surprise
that
everyone
thought
a
good
rain
was
what
was
needed
but
they
never
expected
how
much
rain
would
actually
arrive
Are
you
getting
my
texts
she
texted
to
him
He
glanced
at
it
and
chuckled
under
his
breath
Of
course
he
was
getting
them
but
if
he
wasn`t
getting
them
how
would
he
ever
be
able
to
answer
He
put
the
phone
down
and
continued
on
his
project
He
was
ignoring
her
texts
and
he
planned
to
continue
to
do
so
It
wasn`t
that
he
hated
her
It
was
simply
that
he
didn`t
like
her
much
It
was
difficult
for
him
to
explain
this
to
her
and
even
more
difficult
for
her
to
truly
understand
She
was
in
love
and
wanted
him
to
feel
the
same
way
He
didn`t
and
no
matter
how
he
tried
to
explain
to
her
she
refused
to
listen
or
to
understand
It
went
through
such
rapid
contortions
that
the
little
bear
was
forced
to
change
his
hold
on
it
so
many
times
he
became
confused
in
the
darkness
and
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
tell
whether
he
held
the
sheep
right
side
up
or
upside
down
But
that
point
was
decided
for
him
a
moment
later
by
the
animal
itself
who
with
a
sudden
twist
jabbed
its
horns
so
hard
into
his
lowest
ribs
that
he
gave
a
grunt
of
anger
and
disgust
The
light
was
out
on
the
front
porch
of
the
house
This
was
strange
Judy
couldn`t
remember
a
time
when
she
had
ever
seen
it
out
She
hopped
out
of
her
car
and
walked
to
the
door
It
was
slightly
ajar
and
she
knew
this
meant
something
terrible
She
gently
pushed
the
door
open
and
hall
her
fears
were
realized
Surprise
Happy
Birthday
everyone
shouted
Green
vines
attached
to
the
trunk
of
the
tree
had
wound
themselves
toward
the
top
of
the
canopy
Ants
used
the
vine
as
their
private
highway
avoiding
all
the
creases
and
crags
of
the
bark
to
freely
move
at
top
speed
from
top
to
bottom
or
bottom
to
top
depending
on
their
current
chore
At
least
this
was
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
be
Something
had
damaged
the
vine
overnight
halfway
up
the
tree
leaving
a
gap
in
the
once
pristine
ant
highway
She
wondered
if
the
note
had
reached
him
She
scolded
herself
for
not
handing
it
to
him
in
person
She
trusted
her
friend
but
so
much
could
happen
She
waited
impatiently
for
word
The
box
sat
on
the
desk
next
to
the
computer
It
had
arrived
earlier
in
the
day
and
business
had
interrupted
her
opening
it
earlier
She
didn`t
who
had
sent
it
and
briefly
wondered
who
it
might
have
been
As
she
began
to
unwrap
it
she
had
no
idea
that
opening
it
would
completely
change
her
life
The
answer
was
within
her
reach
It
was
hidden
in
a
box
and
now
that
box
sat
directly
in
front
of
her
She`d
spent
years
searching
for
it
and
could
hardly
believe
she`d
finally
managed
to
find
it
She
turned
the
key
to
unlock
the
box
and
then
gently
lifted
the
top
She
held
her
breath
in
anticipation
of
finally
knowing
the
answer
she
had
spent
so
much
of
her
time
in
search
of
As
the
lid
came
off
she
could
see
that
the
box
was
empty
He
was
after
the
truth
At
least
that`s
what
he
told
himself
He
believed
it
but
any
rational
person
on
the
outside
could
see
he
was
lying
to
himself
It
was
apparent
he
was
really
only
after
his
own
truth
that
he`d
already
decided
and
was
after
this
truth
because
the
facts
didn`t
line
up
with
the
truth
he
wanted
So
he
continued
to
tell
everyone
he
was
after
the
truth
oblivious
to
the
real
truth
sitting
right
in
front
of
him
